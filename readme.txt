This, is an amusing (I think) thing which allows you to literally hurl spawn cars, and make them smash against the edge of the map.
This is to test updating sound, playing 2d, and updating the listener with sound_pool. Contributions are welcome.
keys:
space: spawn a car
backspace: activates the ultrasmash feature, which forloops through all the spawned objects and makes them go smaaaaash.
f and r: Allows you to climb through the air, slightly buggy.
w: Toggles the death whoosh sound when the car smashes
o: checks how many objects there are currently spawned
